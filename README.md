# Guns

This Visual Basic 6 application is a game I developed during the summer of 2001. After launching the executable the user's desktop is shown including a gun. The objective of the game is to shoot down the icons displayed in the desktop.

This is the original read me:

------
                          GUNS
                 The real desktop game
------

Guns is a freeware shooting game.

Right-click somewhere between the game controls to access the Help or to alter the 
highscore and sound settings.

Tech:
-----
This game has been developed using MS Visual Basic 6.0. (sp 5)
It has been tested on Windows 95, 98, 2000, NT, ME and XP.
Since it is freeware you can pick up the code and the game itself at: 
http://emielnijhuis.tripod.com.
Maybe we'll be playing desktop tennis, pool or pinball soon.


Known bugs:
-----------
Sometimes the bullet goes through the target.
For performance reasons I've chosen to not to fix it.
To hit the target just slightly adjust the angle and/or velosity.

Regarding Windows 2000 and Windows NT:
When the Desktop's Auto Arrange property is turned on, this game turns it off. 
However, this action is not displayed in the Desktop's Auto Arrange property.

Regarding Windows 95:
You may need additional software to run the game.
Find and download a file called Msvbvm60.dll on the net and place it in the directory
c:\windows\system.

I'm not interested in other bugs (if any).
